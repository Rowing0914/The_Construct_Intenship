# Weekly Status MTG: 8/4/2019

## Results





## Status

This week, I mainly focused on understanding the source code of OpenAI ROS project and the paper of HER. Since HER has a lot of complicated prior works, e.g., [DQN](https://github.com/Rowing0914/Reinforcement_Learning/tree/master/DRL/papers/DQN), [DPG](https://github.com/Rowing0914/Reinforcement_Learning/tree/master/DRL/papers/DPG) and [DDPG](https://github.com/Rowing0914/Reinforcement_Learning/tree/master/DRL/papers/DDPG), I spent some time for reading them all.

### DONE

- Create a ROSject which will contain all work: [[link]](http://www.rosject.io/l/8d9c152/)
- Summarised the document of OpenAI ROS repo: [[link]](<https://github.com/Rowing0914/The_Construct_Intenship/blob/master/Hindsight_Experience_Replay/OpenAI_ROS.md>)

### PROGRESS

- Understand Hindsight Experience Replay: [[link]](<https://github.com/Rowing0914/Reinforcement_Learning/blob/master/DRL/papers/Experience_Replay/Hindsight_Experience_Replay/README.md>)
- Check the RIA
  - Domain Randomisation
  - OpenAI ROS
- Try reproducing the Fetch environment of the paper in ROSject



## Problems





## Issues

- I need a full access to the contents of RIA courses
- I need a full access to ROSject properties
