# Weekly Status MTG: 8/4/2019

### Last week

- I mainly focused on understanding the source code of OpenAI ROS project and the paper of HER. Since HER has a lot of complicated prior works, e.g., [DQN](https://github.com/Rowing0914/Reinforcement_Learning/tree/master/DRL/papers/DQN), [DPG](https://github.com/Rowing0914/Reinforcement_Learning/tree/master/DRL/papers/DPG) and [DDPG](https://github.com/Rowing0914/Reinforcement_Learning/tree/master/DRL/papers/DDPG), I spent some time for reading them all.

- I am working on reproducing the result of the rosject

### Status

- DONE
  - Create a ROSject which will contain all work: [[link]](http://www.rosject.io/l/8d9c152/)
    - I have cloned the OpenAI ROS repo and been working on here
  - Summarised the document of OpenAI ROS repo: [[link]](<https://github.com/Rowing0914/The_Construct_Intenship/blob/master/Hindsight_Experience_Replay/OpenAI_ROS.md>)

- PROGRESS
  - Understand Hindsight Experience Replay: [[link]](<https://github.com/Rowing0914/Reinforcement_Learning/blob/master/DRL/papers/Experience_Replay/Hindsight_Experience_Replay/README.md>)
  - Check the RIA courses: check the issue,,
    - Domain Randomisation
    - OpenAI ROS
  - Try reproducing the Fetch environment of the paper in ROSject
- TODO
  - Talk to Miguel regarding the status of automatic launching system of simulations
  - Summarise the reproducing work and HER itself on Jupyter notebook with a result of reproduction
  - Read the Multi-goal RL paper when possible

### Problems

no problem found

### Issues

- I need a full access to the contents of RIA courses
- I need a full access to ROSject properties
- The bottom of a terminal window on ROSject is cut off...

### Plan of this week

- Need to show the result of training of pushing env
- Create a script which
  - start a Gazebo simulation of a table and an object we are going to push

- Finish reviewing HER
- Finish taking RIA courses
