### Status

- DONE
  - Create a ROSject which will contain all work: [[link]](http://www.rosject.io/l/8d9c152/)
    - I have cloned the OpenAI ROS repo and been working on here
  - Summarised the document of OpenAI ROS repo: [[link]](<https://github.com/Rowing0914/The_Construct_Intenship/blob/master/Hindsight_Experience_Replay/OpenAI_ROS.md>)
- Understand Hindsight Experience Replay: [[link]](<https://github.com/Rowing0914/Reinforcement_Learning/blob/master/DRL/papers/Experience_Replay/Hindsight_Experience_Replay/README.md>)
  - Check the RIA courses: check the issue,,
    - Domain Randomisation
    - OpenAI ROS
  - Talk to Miguel regarding the status of automatic launching system of simulations
  
- PROGRESS
  - Try reproducing the Fetch environment of the paper in ROSject
  - Summarise the reproducing work and HER itself on Jupyter notebook with a result of reproduction
- TO-DO
  - Read the Multi-goal RL paper when possible

### Confirmation

- I need to double-check the task environment design, might will have another unknown error
- Need to confirm how to push the work on GitHub because I have changed the task-env quite a lot so that I wonder where I should push the project
- I have exams on 1st, 16th, 17th, 20th 23rd in May so that I would like to save enough time on the prep if possible

### Plan of this week

1. answer what kind of data are used in paper: observation, action, reward

2. being able to explain what are the actions from the neural network
3. being able to explain how to apply these values to the network
